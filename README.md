## Requirements

- Node.js v14 or later
- NPM v7 or later
- NPM modules installed:

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

## Testing

In your terminal:

```sh
npm run test
```
